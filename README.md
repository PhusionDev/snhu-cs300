### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course I was tasked with exploring various data structures and algorithms used in Computer Science. The main ideas were that of solving problems and finding the most efficient ways to do so in different situations. I learned about different sorting algorithms and how each of them could be coded, how they worked, and how well or fast they performed with data sets. I learned about different structures for holding and accessing data such as arrays, vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. I learned about resursive functions that call themselves to aggregate a result, which I was able to implement extensively when designing a binary search tree. All of these things learned were so that I could effectively analyze which data structures and algorithms might best be suited for loading a csv containing a college's list of courses, storing that information, and then sorting and displaying those courses in alphanumeric order.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by looking at each of the data structures and algorithms and evaluating their performance in regards to basic operations speed such as creation/insert, searching/access, sorting, and printing. Memory usage can also play a part in the analysis of data structures and algorithms, but for this project it was on such a small scale with virtually unlimited resources that memory contraints were not taken into great consideration. However it's always important to understand the data that your application will be working with, such as the size and volume, and additionally the hardware in which the application will run on to make sure that it will run effectively without running out of resources.
